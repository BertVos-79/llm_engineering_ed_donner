    "When calling ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm() we can add the parameter callbacks=[StdOutCallbackHandler()] to see the chunks that get sent to the llm.\n",

    "Sometimes, these chunks do not provide the informational context that actually is there in the data. If this is the case, we can review the way we chunk the data:\n",

    "- increase the number of chunks; a general rule for llms: the more context, the better. Llms are very good at selecting relevant elements from a context they are provided with. So, increasing the number of chunks that are offered as context is an easy way to try to resolve the issue.\n",
    "- one can also make the chunks larger, for example, make them encompass whole documents;\n",
    "- or, on the contrary, make the chunks smaller;\n",
    "- or, one can play with the overlap between chunks, and for example increase the overlap to make sure relevant information will be detected.\n",
