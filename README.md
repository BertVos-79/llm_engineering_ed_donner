# LLM Engineering: Master AI & Large Language Models (LLMs)  
### Ed Donner on Udemy  

---

## Course Overview  
In this repository, you will find my Jupyter Notebooks for the projects I completed during the course *LLM Engineering: Master AI & Large Language Models (LLMs)* by Ed Donner on Udemy. This course provides a broad overview of the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications, equipping participants with practical skills to tackle real-world challenges in AI.  

The course is highly project-driven, focusing on hands-on applications of LLMs in various domains. The projects include:  

- **Project 1**: Create an AI-powered brochure generator that intelligently scrapes and navigates company websites.  
- **Project 2**: Develop a multi-modal customer support agent for an airline, complete with a user interface and function-calling capabilities.  
- **Project 3**: Build a tool to create meeting minutes and action items from audio recordings using both open- and closed-source models.  
- **Project 4**: Implement AI that converts Python code into optimized C++, achieving performance boosts of up to 60,000x.  
- **Project 5**: Construct an AI knowledge-worker using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling expertise on all company-related matters.  
- **Project 6**: **Capstone Part A** – Predict product prices from short descriptions using Frontier models.  
- **Project 7**: **Capstone Part B** – Fine-tune open-source models to rival Frontier in price prediction tasks.  
- **Project 8**: **Capstone Part C** – Build an autonomous multi-agent system that collaborates with models to spot deals and notify you of special bargains.  

This combination of practical projects and theoretical insights ensures that learners develop both foundational knowledge and practical expertise in LLM engineering.
